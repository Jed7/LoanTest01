# Read me !
First & Simple collaborative work around a python project.
The goal is to learn how to communicate as a team, to improve the code, to see how to build a web interface for the app, and to work directly with the blockchain.

# The app
The purpose of this project is to write a web app where users can log and see the progression of their capital.

# Context
Two Users gathered some ETH and are lending them, through an exchange, to margin traders. This loan is producing interests.
The reporting is currently produced by hand, data are pasted in an excell file. The idea is to design a program that will do all the reporting automatically.

# The calculations
The two users put together a different amount of ETH in the common capital. Therefore they receive a different percentage of the interest produced daily.
User 1 is taking care of the process, therefore he receive a fee for his service. 5% of user2's profit.
Providing there's a loan, the calculation is made everyday.

# The possible actions
ETH can be added or withdrawn by users, along the way.

Thank you !
